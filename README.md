# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Laptop Pricing and Used Car Pricing Datasets

## Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on two real-world datasets:
1. **Laptop Pricing Dataset**: Contains data on laptop specifications and their prices.
2. **Used Car Pricing Dataset**: Contains information on used car features and their prices.

The goal of this project is to analyze individual feature patterns, visualize data distributions, and understand relationships between features through various statistical and visualization techniques.

## Project Objectives

- **Feature Analysis**: Analyze the patterns of individual features in the datasets.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to explore data distributions and identify trends.
- **Descriptive Statistical Analysis**: Compute and interpret summary statistics for each feature.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examine correlations between features to understand their relationships.
- **Grouping and Aggregation**: Group data by certain features to summarize and analyze data trends.

## Datasets

### Laptop Pricing Dataset
- **Features**: Brand, Model, RAM, Storage, Processor, Screen Size, Price, etc.

### Used Car Pricing Dataset
- **Features**: Brand, Model, Year, Mileage, Fuel Type, Price, etc.

## Getting Started

To begin with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DhananjayTalekar/Exploratory-Data-Analysis.git
cd Exploratory-Data-Analysis
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare the Data

- Place your datasets in the `data/` directory. Ensure they are in CSV format and correctly named.
- Update any file paths in the scripts or notebooks if needed.

### 4. Explore the Data

You can perform the exploratory data analysis using the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts:

- **Data Exploration**
- **Data Visualization**
- **Descriptive Statistics**
- **Correlation Analysis**
- **Grouping and Aggregation**

### 5. Review Results

Check the notebooks for visualizations, statistical summaries, and insights derived from the data. Analyze the output to understand feature patterns, correlations, and data groupings.
